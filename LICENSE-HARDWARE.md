# FPP-3 Film/Paper Processor – Hardware License

Project: FPP-3 Film/Paper Processor  
Author / Designer: Luis Samaniego  
Years: 2024–2025

This file applies **only** to the *hardware* design of the FPP-3 Film/Paper Processor  
(mechanical design, enclosure, wiring, PCB layouts, schematics, etc.).

The **software / firmware** running on the controller is licensed separately under the  
GNU General Public License, version 3 or later (see `LICENSE.md` and `COPYING`).

## 1. License

The hardware design files of the FPP-3 Film/Paper Processor are licensed under the

**CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 – Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)**

You may obtain a copy of the full license text at:

- https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt  
- https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2

In case of any discrepancy between this summary and the full CERN-OHL-S-2.0 text,
the official CERN-OHL-S-2.0 license text prevails.

---

## 2. Scope

This license covers, for example:

- Mechanical design drawings, 3D models, and dimensioned sketches  
- PCB layouts, schematics, wiring diagrams, and connector pinouts  
- Assembly drawings and bill of materials (BOM) related to the FPP-3 hardware

It does **not** cover:

- Firmware / Arduino sketches / software (see `LICENSE.md` and `COPYING`)  
- Third-party hardware modules used in the build (e.g. Arduino/Elegoo boards,  
  commercial motor drivers, displays, power supplies, JOBO® tanks, etc.),  
  which remain under their respective manufacturers’ licenses and trademarks.

## 3. Your rights under CERN-OHL-S-2.0 (short summary, non-binding)

Subject to the terms of CERN-OHL-S-2.0, you are free to:

- **Use** the hardware design for any purpose (personal, educational, commercial).  
- **Study** and understand how it works.  
- **Modify** the design to suit your needs.  
- **Make** and **sell** hardware products based on the design.

If you convey or manufacture products based on a **modified** version of these
design files, you must:

- Release your modified design files **under CERN-OHL-S-2.0 as well**  
  (this is the “strongly reciprocal” part).  
- Provide the *Complete Source* (as defined in CERN-OHL-S-2.0) to your recipients.  
- Preserve existing license notices, copyright notices, and disclaimers.

This is only a human-readable summary. The legally binding terms are contained
in the official CERN-OHL-S-2.0 license.

## 4. Third-party trademarks and components

- **JOBO** is a registered trademark of its respective owner.  
  FPP-3 is an independent project and is not affiliated with, or endorsed by, JOBO.

All references to third-party products (e.g. Arduino boards, JOBO tanks, motor
drivers, power supplies) are for compatibility and descriptive purposes only.
Their designs, logos, and trademarks remain the property of their respective owners.

## 5. Disclaimer of warranty and liability

This hardware is provided **“as is”**, without any express or implied warranty.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the author/designers make  
**no warranties** regarding:

- Fitness for a particular purpose  
- Safety of operation  
- Compliance with local regulations, electrical codes, or laboratory standards

You are solely responsible for:

- Ensuring safe mains wiring and grounding  
- Providing appropriate fusing and over-current protection  
- Verifying that the build complies with your local safety and electrical regulations  
- Verifying suitability of the design for your intended use (chemistry, temperatures,
  load, duty cycle, etc.)

In no event shall the author/designers be liable for any claim, damages, or other
liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of,  
or in connection with the hardware or the use or other dealings in the hardware.

## 6. Contributing

By submitting hardware design contributions (mechanical parts, PCBs, wiring
improvements, etc.) intended to be included in the main FPP-3 project, you agree
that your contributions are licensed under **CERN-OHL-S-2.0** and may be redistributed
under those terms.

If you prefer a different licensing arrangement for a specific contribution, you
must state this clearly and in writing when submitting it.
