# FPP-3 Film/Paper Processor – Hardware License

The hardware design files of the FPP-3 Film/Paper Processor are licensed
under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 – Strongly Reciprocal**
(**CERN-OHL-S-2.0**).

This covers in particular (but is not limited to):

- Mechanical designs (enclosure, brackets, mounts, panels, etc.)
- 3D models (CAD files, STL/STEP, etc.)
- Electrical schematics and PCB layouts
- Wiring diagrams and other hardware design documentation

The **Arduino firmware and any other software** in this repository are
licensed separately under the **GNU General Public License, Version 3**
(GPL-3.0). See the `LICENSE` file for details on the software license.

## Your rights and obligations (hardware)

This is only an informal summary. The **full legal terms** are given in
the official CERN-OHL-S-2.0 text, which is included in this repository
(see `cern_ohl_s_v2.txt`) and is also available from CERN.

Under CERN-OHL-S-2.0 you may, in particular:

- **Use** the hardware design and manufactured devices for any purpose.
- **Study** the design and make your own copies.
- **Modify** the design and manufacture modified versions.
- **Distribute** the design files and/or physical devices, commercially
  or non-commercially.

However, if you distribute **products** or **design files** based on
this hardware (for example, if you sell assembled FPP-3 units, PCBs,
or modified enclosures), you must:

1. **Provide the complete “Source” of the hardware design**  
   This includes the original design files and any modifications you
   made (schematics, board layouts, CAD files, etc.) in the preferred
   format for making changes.

2. **License your modifications under CERN-OHL-S-2.0**  
   You must keep your modified design under the same license, so that
   others receive the same freedoms you did.

3. **Provide a copy of the CERN-OHL-S-2.0 license text**  
   Either with the physical product or alongside the design files.

4. **Keep appropriate notices and attribution**  
   You must keep copyright, license, and attribution notices and
   clearly state any changes you have made.

This means you are **free to commercialize** FPP-3 hardware (e.g.
sell kits, assembled units, or derivatives), but you must also
release your corresponding hardware design files under CERN-OHL-S-2.0.

## How to apply this license to your own derivatives

If you create and distribute a modified version of the FPP-3 hardware,
you should:

1. Keep the original copyright and license notices.
2. Add your own copyright notice, for example:

   > Copyright © 2025 Your Name

3. State clearly that your design is licensed under CERN-OHL-S-2.0.
4. Include the full CERN-OHL-S-2.0 license text with your distribution.
5. Make the complete hardware source (design files) available to the
   recipients (for example via a public git repository or download URL).

## Disclaimer

The FPP-3 hardware design is provided **“as is”**, without any warranty
of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement. In no event shall the author(s) be liable for any
claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the
hardware or the use or other dealings in the hardware design or
devices manufactured from it.
